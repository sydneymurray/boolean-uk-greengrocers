Today's exercise: Greengrocers

Repo: boolean-uk-greengrocers

Description
In this exercise we explore a common scenario in eCommerce, adding and removing items from the cart, and calculating the total.

Deliverables
- A user can view a selection of items in the store
- From the store, a user can add an item to their cart
- From the cart, a user can view and adjust the number of items in their cart
    - If an item's quantity equals zero it is removed from the cart
- A user can view the current total in their cart

Instructions
- Use this template as a starting point => https://codesandbox.io/s/js-exercise-greengrocer-template-grqi6
- Create a state object
- Create action functions that update state
- Create render functions that read from state

Tips
- Start with the logic first, use console.log(state) to check your logic is working; when the logic is working as expected move onto styling
- Taking HTML semantics into consideration, use a button when an action is happening on the same page

Challenge
Create a json-server, and make your app persist the data 

Challenge 2
- Add filters to the store ie. filter by item type; when a user clicks a filter they will only see items of that type
- Add sorting to the store ie. sort by price or sort alphabetically; when a user clicks sort they will see a sorted list of items
